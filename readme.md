Workflow: PNG to Dancing Soft-Body Mesh
This document outlines the complete process for transforming a static PNG image into a dynamic, deformable soft-body mesh using Three.js for rendering and Matter.js for physics.
Step 1: Generate an Optimized SVG Path from Your PNG
The first stage is to convert your raster PNG image into a clean, low-vertex vector outline. This SVG path will define the shape of the final deformable object. We'll use Inkscape for this task.
Set Up a Tracing Environment: Tracing tools rely on high contrast. If your PNG has light colors, you'll need to place it against a dark background.
Import your PNG into Inkscape (File > Import).
Open the Layers panel (Shift+Ctrl+L) and add a new layer below your image.
On the new layer, draw a large, dark rectangle behind your PNG.
Trace the Bitmap: This step creates the raw vector path.
Select your PNG image.
Open the "Trace Bitmap" tool (Path > Trace Bitmap...).
Under the "Single scan" tab, select "Brightness cutoff" mode.
Enable "Live Preview" and adjust the Threshold slider until you have a clean, solid silhouette of your character.
Click Apply.
Isolate and Simplify the Path: This is a critical step for performance.
Drag the newly created vector path off of the original PNG. You can now delete the original PNG and the background layer.
Select the new vector path and use the Simplify function (Path > Simplify or Ctrl+L) repeatedly. The goal is to reduce the number of vertices (nodes) as much as possible while preserving the essential shape of the character.
To check your progress, select the path, switch to the "Edit paths by nodes" tool (F2), and press Ctrl+A. The status bar will display the node count. Aim for a target between 40 and 70 vertices for a good balance of detail and performance.
You now have an optimized SVG path file ready for the next steps.
Step 2: Create the Deformable Mesh in Three.js
Next, we'll set up the visual component in Three.js. This involves creating a 2D shape from your SVG path and applying your original PNG as a texture.
Create the Geometry: The geometry defines the object's structure and the vertices that the physics engine will manipulate.
First, extract the x, y coordinates from your SVG path's d attribute.
Convert these points into an array of THREE.Vector2 objects.
Use this array of vectors to create a THREE.Shape.
Finally, generate the geometry by creating a THREE.ShapeGeometry from your shape.
Create the Texture: The texture is the image that gets "painted" onto the geometry.
Instantiate a THREE.TextureLoader.
Use the loader's .load() method, providing the file path to your original PNG image.
Create the Material: The material defines the surface properties. We need a basic material that simply displays our texture with transparency.
Create a THREE.MeshBasicMaterial.
In the material's options, set map to the texture you just loaded.
Crucially, set transparent: true to ensure the empty areas of your PNG are rendered as invisible.
Build the Final Mesh: The mesh is the final, renderable object that combines the shape (geometry) and the appearance (material).
Create a THREE.Mesh, passing in your geometry and material.
Add this mesh to your main Three.js scene.
At this point, you will have a static 2D object in your scene that looks exactly like your PNG.
Step 3: Build the Invisible Physics Skeleton in Matter.js
Now, we create an invisible, flexible structure in Matter.js that will act as the "bones" for our visual mesh, allowing it to jiggle and deform.
Create a Group of Bodies: Construct an approximation of your character's shape using a collection of small, overlapping Matter.Bodies.circle objects. Place these bodies at key pivot points inside your shape (e.g., head, torso, limbs).
Connect with Constraints: Link the bodies together using Matter.Constraint. These constraints act like springs or joints. By setting a low stiffness value (e.g., 0.1), you create a flexible, soft-body structure.
Composite the Skeleton: Group all the individual bodies and constraints into a single Matter.Composite. This allows you to manage the entire physics skeleton as a single unit, which you can then add to your Matter.js world.
Step 4: Map Physics to Mesh and Animate
This is the final step where we link the invisible physics simulation to the visible Three.js mesh and run the animation loop.
Create the Mapping: You must establish a direct link between each physics body and the geometry vertex (or vertices) it should control. An array of objects is a good way to store this relationship, where each object contains a reference to a Matter.js body and the corresponding index of the vertex in the Three.js geometry's position attribute.
Create the Animation Loop: This is a function that runs on every frame using requestAnimationFrame.
Update Physics: On each frame, the first step is to call Matter.Engine.update(engine) to advance the physics simulation.
Update Vertices: Loop through your mapping array. For each link, get the new position of the Matter.js body and use it to update the x and y coordinates of the corresponding vertex in the characterMesh.geometry.attributes.position array.
Flag for Update: After modifying the vertices, you must tell Three.js that the geometry has changed by setting characterMesh.geometry.attributes.position.needsUpdate = true;. This signals Three.js to re-upload the vertex data to the GPU.
Render the Scene: Finally, call renderer.render(scene, camera) to draw the newly deformed mesh on the screen.
Once you start the loop, your character will come to life, with the Matter.js physics skeleton driving the real-time deformation of the Three.js mesh.
